# IMDb Dataset Analysis and Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the IMDb dataset to gain insights into the movie industry. Various operations such as data processing and plotting different types of graphs using Seaborn and Matplotlib have been performed to explore the dataset.

## Dataset
The IMDb dataset contains information about movies, including features such as title, genre, release year, runtime, rating, and votes. The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).

## Analysis and Visualization
1. Data Processing: The dataset is cleaned and processed to handle missing values, convert data types, and create new features if necessary.
2. Graphs: Different types of graphs, including bar plots, line plots, scatter plots, and histograms, are plotted to visualize various aspects of the dataset. Examples include:
   - Distribution of movie ratings
   - Relationship between rating and votes
   - Genre distribution
   - Runtime distribution over the years

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vijay7425/IMDB-Dataset-Analysis.git
   cd IMDB-Dataset-Analysis

   
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
    jupyter notebook imdb_dataset_analysis.ipynb

## Results
The analysis and visualization of the IMDb dataset provide valuable insights into the movie industry, including trends in movie ratings, genre popularity, and runtime distribution. 
The project demonstrates the power of data analysis and visualization in uncovering patterns and trends in large datasets.

Feel free to explore the notebook and experiment with different visualizations to gain further insights into the IMDb dataset!
